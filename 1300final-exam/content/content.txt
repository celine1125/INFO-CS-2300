History
Ithaca Electrics was founded in 1900 C.E. by a group of Ithaca natives who wanted access to state-of-the-art technology and support. A little-known fact is that cellphones were first conceived of by one of the founders of Ithaca Electronics! After moving between a variety of locations and almost going out of business during the Great Depression, we finally settled at our current State Street location in 1942. Our motto since 1980 has been "Brightening the Community."
